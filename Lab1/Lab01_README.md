Lab01 - Universality: Sick of Burning
Mia Dunn

This project focuses on simulating the spread of forest fires and diseases within the same model, spread_sim. The simulations explore various parameters, including probability of spread and initial conditions, and how they affect the spread.

The simulations are represented on a grid, with different values associated with different states of the spread.

The functions can take in a variety of parameters, including size of grid and probability of spread, initial bare/immune cells, initial burning/sick cells, and fatality from disease.

There are four helper functions: explore_burnrate, vary_bare, explore_survivalrate, and vary_immune. Each of these helper functions produce a plot with relevent data to understand how the simulation works.
